And it’s speaking out, not staying silent, not hiding away from helping, because with neighborliness comes an obligation to neighborhood. It’s not just one-to-one care and decency, but the realization that this mutual web of support is the whole of the moral life.

And Trump's ultimately a branding guy. That's his whole thing. He slaps his name on things, and makes money from his name being on those things. He's a showman, and a successful showman responds to his audience. When Trump tried things eight years ago and discovered they were broadly hated, or weren't playing well in the media he wanted to get glowing reviews from, he'd pivot.

But the \"mostly okay\" of that first term was the product of Trump having relatively normal people around him and Trump not wanting to be unpopular. What elites got wrong, then, is that in a second term, Trump picked the worst of the worst to fill the White House, and he'd aged out of the cognitive faculties needed for him to recognize his lack of popularity. You occasionally see something break through to him (he backs down sometimes on tariffs, and the White House is circling the wagons on Hegseth's war crimes). But his decline is accelerating. And the Voughts and Millers who can see the unpopularity aren't likely to back down themselves, but instead do everything they can to inflict as much damage as possible before the American people kick them to the curb in 2028."

The only way to maintain the initial pattern, then, is to restrict people’s liberty to deviate from it.

But what is clear is that the fusionist alliance has broken down as so many American conservatives, most acutely since the rise of Donald Trump, have abandoned whatever libertarian values they might once have held, expressing more concern about preventing the cultural and racial change brought by immigration, or punishing corporations that express or provide platforms for non‐conservative values, than with small government and economic liberty."

In this case, the conservative sees that liberty has disrupted his favored patterns, but he still sees the government’s role as maximizing liberty. But notice that, in taking this path, our conservative isn’t a political conservative at all, because now his political philosophy is aimed at maintaining maximum liberty. Thus there’s no need to make a case for the compatibility of conservatism and libertarianism, because the conservative and the libertarian are now both libertarians, though perhaps with different cultural tastes."

In many ways, Silicon Valley looks less like capitalism and more like a nonprofit. The way you get rich isn’t to sell products to consumers, because you’re likely giving away your product for free, and your customers wouldn’t pay for it if you tried to charge them. If you’re a startup, and not FAANG, the way you pay your bills is to convince someone who’s already rich to give you money. Maybe that’s a venture capital investment, but if you want to get really rich yourself, it’s selling your business to one of the big guys."

Instead, you’re selling a vision and then a story of how you’ll achieve it. This is the case if you go to a VC, it’s the case if you get a larger firm to buy you, and it’s the case if you’re talking ordinary investors into buying your stock. (Tesla’s stock price is plummeting because Musk’s brand has made Tesla’s brand toxic. But Tesla’s corporate board can’t get rid of him, because investors bought Tesla’s stock—and pumped it to clearly overvalued levels—precisely because they believe in the myth of Musk as a world-historical innovator who will, any day now, unleash the innovations that’ll bring unlimited profits.)

Reposts both put your post in front of more people who will repost it and keep it alive, so new people keep seeing it, even if it's old enough that otherwise it'd be crowded out of their feed. This also means, if you want to consistently go viral and build an audience, with a chronological feed you'll post a lot.

Yes, you keep your followers and so if you post slowly you still have the same number of potential viewers.

They ask because they see Jesus’s behavior as the best possible example through which to become more ethical themselves.

Because virtues are habits of character, dispositions to see the world in certain ways and to act out of that perspective, the pairing of awareness (noticing unskillful mental states when they arise) and mindfulness (remembering to maintain that awareness and to instead practice skillful mental states) support each other in creating deep and lasting habits of virtue.

This entails intentionally giving rise to internal states of goodwill and then maintaining a focus on them through the session, which can last as little as a few minutes, and so is accessible to even the busiest of us. Essentially, metta meditation is teaching yourself to feel goodwill and then focusing on that feeling so that it becomes a natural part of who you are, even when the timer dings and the session ends. Going back again to the fitness analogy, if you lift weights regularly in the artificial and controlled setting of the gym, you don’t just become better at lifting weights. You become stronger, and that strength persists when you leave the gym. (I don’t have space here to set out the details of how to practice metta meditation, but if you are interested—and you should be, because it is a beneficial and lovely experience, I encourage you to start with the writings and guided audio instructions of Tasshin Fogleman.)"

It’s not just that people who critique us are wrong, it’s that they’re bad—and we’re inclined to think they reject the very idea of merit itself. But it’s awful difficult to actually think of communities that reject merit, or reject the idea that people should be rewarded for worthy things. Instead, there are disagreements about what we should be rewarded for. In many communities once dominated by men, the entrance of women has meant a declining relative status of those men. Men used to be at a top, were the most well-respected, and their ideas defining the community’s consensus. Men who made it to the top sometimes did so for meritorious reasons, but frequently what counted as “merit” was instead behaviors that fall under what we’d now label “toxic masculinity,” for example. Aggressiveness, lack of empathy, petulance in the face of critique, and a systematic exclusion of questioning viewpoints from women and minorities."

Women have historically, systematically been excluded from many institutions, and so those institutions had an internal culture that, among other features, was one that excluded women, and was accepting of that exclusion, and saw that exclusion as the result of meritocracy. Thus when women enter those institutions, their very presence, and then their ascension to positions of power and leadership, is viewed by some members of the male-dominated community, and particularly those who benefited from it, as evidence not that those women have merit, but that meritocracy is in retreat. Women must be DEI hires, or the result of unjust affirmative action, or only supplanting (some) men in the status and merit hierarchy because standards have fallen. Getting outside of your interpretive community’s bubble is an important first step."

Among artworks, there are those that are “allographic” and those that are “autographic.” The latter are the sculptures and bespoke shoes: The work of art is what the artist held in her hand and shaped or stitched. It is art about which we can coherently speak of forgeries. A perfect copy of a bespoke shoe isn’t the same as the original. It’s just a copy, even if “perfect.” Allographic art, on the other hand, is art where every copy really is the original. If I publish a novel, we don’t talk about there being an “original” and each paperback copy as a mere copy. Rather, each paperback you buy of my novel is the novel. The same holds for recorded music, movies on film or digital, and so on. There might be one-off variants we attach particular weight to (signed first editions, first pressings, and so on), but we don’t attach weight to them because they are somehow more authentically the novel or the song than the third printing or the high def MP3 download. Rather, they are a particularly valued variant of that basic artwork."

You didn’t need to actually handle any product yourself, because your business was taking orders and then passing them along, with payment, to someone else who would box them up and put them in the mail to your (and their) customer."

Not the least because, in those 16 years, I made real and important friends through Twitter. The platform meant a lot to me. So as my little commemoration, and moment of self-indulgence, I’m reprinting below a very short essay I wrote—originally as a Tweet thread—ages ago when one of those friends, who meant an awful lot to me, died unexpectedly. Five years later, I still miss him, and I hope this essay can give a sense of what it is Elon Musk has destroyed, and why social media, as many problems as it has, still matters—and still brings value."

She wanted independence, and control and ownership of her creative output, and she couldn’t get it within The Verge right now. That, by itself, is unremarkable—even if Farsace’s talents are. What’s interesting about the narrative framing isn’t the particulars of Farsace’s leaving her employer for the better part of a decade for something new, but rather how the framing reflects the way people tend to view networks and markets from a narrowly focused and static perspective, a perspective that obfuscates many of the benefits of dynamic markets as networks, instead of as individual transactions."

And it’s possible, in making the decision to hire a 22 year old, that they expected the balance there to not be in their favor for some time. Young and inexperienced workers are typically paid less than their older and more experienced colleagues because they are less productive. They produce less value for their employer on, say, a per hour basis than someone who’s been doing it longer and has developed their skills. So when you’re hiring young and inexperienced employees, you’re typically banking on them becoming more productive as their skills develop."

Roughly, the rule ought to be that if it is permissible to harshly criticize someone when they are alive, or to do so some length of time after their death, it is permissible to criticize them on the day of their death—or in the week following, or during whatever period those who argue against speaking ill have in mind."

Robertson clearly fell into this camp, even if he mistakenly believed he was acting in a Christian manner and in accord with Christ-like values.

Basically all of us could come up with a name or two, and so has a line, even if not an entirely clear one, over which it is okay to speak ill of the dead. The notion of a moral prohibition on doing so isn’t really about whether it is ever okay to criticize someone on the day of their death, but rather that the particulars of the criticism aren’t necessarily widely agreed upon. Lots of people sadly liked Pat Robertson and his beliefs. They feel the same bigotry and hate he did, and so criticizing him is criticizing them. But that some people will disagree with a moral judgment isn’t a reason to avoid making it, or to avoid articulating it. In fact, the presence of moral disagreement is a strong reason to discuss it."

Pete Hegseth is the self-proclaimed Secretary of War in the second Trump administration and a self-proclaimed warrior of the MAGA ideology. His showing off isn’t (just) to impress any women or bros who might happen upon his Instagram feed. Pete Hegseth’s showing off is intended to convey a message about, or a particular image of, MAGA ideology. The reason America needs to be made great again is because it’s no longer great, and the reason it’s no longer great is that men far weaker than Pete Hegseth, or far weaker than Pete Hegseth tells himself and all of us he is, have corrupted it away from manliness and strength and manly strength. Pete Hegseth, and the rest of the second Trump administration, do what fascists always do, which is to project what they believe to be intimidating power through images of what they believe to be traditional masculinity. And for fascists like Pete Hegseth and his colleagues in the second Trump administration and his fans on social media, traditional masculinity means muscles and the threat or willingness to use them to inflict violence on those the fascists imagine to be weaker than themselves or weaker than their movement or weaker than their manly ideology."

You might think Pete knows his swings are crap, but also knows the people watching won’t know that. But that’s to misunderstand MAGA ideology. It is a movement wholly consumed by the maintenance of a constructed identity. When there is no substantive reality to the self—no actual expertise, no cultivation of skill—the self must be continuously hallucinated into existence through performance. So Pete’s narrative of self-identity paints the white nationalist fans in Dear Leader’s personality cult as modern incarnations of the Spartan warriors who existed historically in Plutarch’s stub biography of Lycurgus, but exist more clearly in the minds of Pete and those shlubby guys as they appear in Frank Miller and Zack Snyder’s wet dream, 300.

The problem with the deal was that libertarians were correct about government, but conservatives were wrong about virtue.

At the same time, lawmakers on the left, who in fact hold pro-liberty views on a range of issues, get tarnished as “socialists.” They are only the enemy because they happen to hold non-libertarian views in a leftward direction."

They like to believe they are owed success because they are better (more skilled, more able, more intelligent) than the people who historically have had less of it. And when the barriers keeping those historically less successful people out of their domains of success break down, they rage. Not because, with scattered and rare exceptions, they're actually being discriminated against, but because these new entrants, perhaps because they had to be that much better to overcome those barriers, frequently outperform them. These men, who for decades have been the loudest about America needing meritocracy, discover they don't do as well as they anticipated when it more fully arrives."

People who are responsible for your declining status, in their unjust and unearned seeking of their own. So you want to strike out. You want to degrade the people you blame for making you feel smaller. And by degrading them, by abusing them, you can feel bigger and more powerful, even if you can't claw back a feeling of actual success. Being an abuser means, if nothing else, you're above the abused. And if you can abuse everyone except the people most like you, then it means you and the people like you are at the top. Which is all the MAGA movement has ever wanted. People like them getting to dominate, getting to inflict abuse without consequences, is what it means, ultimately, in their minds, for America to be great."

If the answer to fights about curriculum is “school choice,” then “school choice” ought to be the answer to fights about curriculum in universities. And the think about universities is, unlike primary and secondary education, we already have nearly perfect school choice. Chances are, if you went to public school for K through 12, you went to the school assigned to you by wherever your home address happened to be. You didn’t have a choice. But if you went to a public university, chances are you had quite an array of ones to pick from. I grew up outside of Detroit but attended the University of Colorado, and could have attended universities in pretty much any of the fifty states. And I could’ve picked a private university (as I did for law school) if I couldn’t find a public one I liked. In other words, if the answer to fights about what views should be represented in a given school is simply “If we had school choice, parents could send their kids to a school representing their views, and so there’s no need to fight about any particular school,” then that same answer should trump calls for any given university to be viewpoint diverse. The CU Boulder English department was pretty lefty, true. But I could’ve gone to Hillsdale."

But the regime is also meeting quite a lot of failures, and lacks both the intelligence and discipline to succeed in many of its aims. What this means is that, at this moment, it hasn’t yet fully consolidated authoritarianism in America, and it very well might never achieve it. The 2026 elections could result in a landslide for Democrats, who could then use the power of the purse to defund most all of the worst of what Trump’s up to. The 2028 election could result in a full scale repudiation of MAGA, and then the question becomes not defeating authoritarianism, but rebuilding after it.

Yes, this story is making the news now, but let’s not forget about that other one. Yes, everyone is talking about that, but immediate suffering can be more effectively alleviated by putting our effort into this, instead. Etc.

To cut side deals with authoritarianism. To keep your head down, to flatter, to hope that fire stays very far away from you personally, and look for ways to maybe find a little warmth in it while it’s here. Such attitudes must be rejected.

Thus if our thought leadership is mostly interacting with the kind of hard-right and profoundly immoral perspectives of the community Elon Musk has cultivated and promoted, and is reflected in electoral politics by people like JD Vance, then this is bad for those thought leaders, because to the extent it makes them increasingly unethical, in both values and the way they see the world, it makes their own lives worse.

I said, “You argue that this change will increase both productivity and collaboration. But there’s robust evidence that it will do precisely the opposite.

So your second option is to trust the judgement of other experts and to put a thumb on the scale for expert consensus. If everyone who knows a lot about a topic believes one thing about that topic, it’s probably better, lacking expertise yourself, to go with their consensus than to assume the random heterodox thinker has it right. That’s not foolproof, of course. The consensus can be wrong, and heterodox thinkers have been proven right. But it’s a decent heuristic."

Rather, we should think of success as, roughly, having the life you want, or having the life that makes you happy. If that’s being a titan of industry, so be it. But the monk living in the woods and never earning a dime, or the “underemployed” person making enough to afford a simple lifestyle they find contentment with, is equally successful."

A liberal society is inevitably messy, but messiness is not nihilism. And cultivating traits of goodwill and sympathetic joy will make us better able to recognize genuinely unskillful intentions, while cultivating or giving into ill-will and resentment will make us far less likely to recognize and appreciate others’ skillful happiness."

Illiberals see any happiness and success that doesn’t align with their preferences as false, inauthentic, mistaken or corrupt. Thus, to return to the prior example, transgender people aren’t actually happy in their gender identity, but are instead mentally ill and secretly miserable. Illiberals on the left can make a similar move, assuming that people who freely choose “traditionally” conservative lifestyles, or hold to restrictive religious faiths or opt to raise children instead of seeking careers, aren’t genuinely happy and aren’t meaningfully successful."

If illiberalism takes strength from intolerance, then cultivating virtues that go beyond tolerance into sympathetic joy strengthens liberalism’s defenses. And if we’ve come to view the happiness of others as a key component of our own happiness, then restricting their freedom to pursue success as they define it will be seen as not only making them worse off, but ourselves as well.

Living in a liberal society will be quite miserable if we constantly resent different kinds of happiness and self-expression and harbor ill-will for those experiencing and embracing them. As Tibetan scholar Traleg Kyabgon puts it, “Feelings such as resentment and bitterness gradually make us weak, frustrated, and unhappy, rather than having any impact on the person toward whom we direct these emotions.” On the other hand, living in a liberal society will become not just tolerable, but a genuine delight, if we possess the virtue of sympathetic joy. Thus as liberal citizens, these virtues are a means to great life satisfaction, which we all should want and strive for."

Not only of the fundamental morality and justice of a political system aimed at maximizing the liberty of all to author their own lives and live in peace with others doing the same, but also that I wanted to dedicate my life to helping realize that world. Through college and then law school, that was the dream. And the dream on top of that dream was to work at the Cato Institute, because that’s where David worked, and it was the organization dedicated to putting into practice the ideas he set out and defended in his primer."

I was a pretty good writer, and a pretty good synthesizer, and so I applied. And got invited for an interview—with two complications. First, I had to write a report on a Cato event as a test. Second, the job wasn’t just in the same building as David, but reporting directly to him. That meant the very first time I’d meet my intellectual hero was in an interview. I was terrified."

An online friend, in reviewing it, wrote, “It feels more like reunion bonus content for the original than a proper movie in its own right, but that's okay.” It is okay. In fact, it’s probably the only right way to handle a Spinal Tap reunion, given the distance between the last film and this one."

Harry Shearer is 81. All four have had wildly successful careers since This is Spinal Tap debuted in 1984. The characters they created went from making fun of rock and roll culture to becoming a central part of it, the way The Godfather shaped the Mafia. The cameos in Spinal Tap 2, and they’re very famous cameos from musicians who are themselves part of rock’s pantheon, have an air of giddiness about getting to hang out with the guys from Spinal Tap."

Most of the movie takes place in a single location, an Airbnb in New Orleans where the band practices before their one-night reunion concert. Gone are the set pieces of the first, replaced by visits from friends. And that’s what this movie is, and why I think it works even when so many critics say it doesn’t. Given their ages, there’s no second career for the band to tell the story of. Really nowhere new and exciting to go. It’s not really a sequel. That’s not the point. The point is that, somehow (and that somehow has to do with lawsuits and finally winning back the rights to their movie), David and Nigel and Derek and Marty get to have a reunion and another show and an opportunity to catch up. And we, as fans, as people who love these characters, get the same. It’s an indulgence, and it’s for the fans, and it’s for the characters, and that’s enough."

And the ham-handed mechanism by which this status reordering was to take effect would be making blue checks something you could just purchase. Eight bucks a month would get you one, and with that badge you’d be one of the elite, too. All those eggheads, effete cultural influencers, soy boys, mainstream media personalities, and other darlings of society’s liberal institutions would have no choice but to take you seriously.

And then Musk tweaked the algorithm to make those new blue checks unavoidable, filling the For You tab with them, and elevating their replies above everyone who refused to send him eight bucks a month.

But why someone suffers that fate matters. The assumption, by people who see cancel culture as a new and grave threat, is that canceling typically attaches to holding opinions, mainly political opinions, that are outside the Overton Window of elite, largely left, consensus. But because there’s nothing inherently wrong with views that don’t align with the consensus, such canceling is unjust. It’s unfair."

The worst forms of this take the mere airing of disagreement or alternative perspectives as harmful, as rising to the level of a (definitionally weird) kind of violence. We can find stories of people unjustly “canceled”—I personally know people who’ve suffered this fate—and we shouldn’t dismiss those, or let the perpetrators off the hook simply because they are acting out of a commitment to values we might share. Freedom of expression is critical for a well-functioning, liberal society, and those who would do away with it in the name of intellectual conformity deserve criticism or condemnation."

Incels spin out elaborate theories about ideology and feminism rather than recognizing that maybe they can’t get a date because they come off poorly, are rude, seem condescending, or otherwise behave in ways that make them unattractive. Elon stans spin out theories, though maybe less thorough ones, about how them getting blocked is because the blockers can’t handle their Reason and Logic and Truth—but the rather more mundane reality is that, as anyone with a sufficiently large Twitter following knows, reply guys are simply irritating."

We can’t dismiss either of these out of hand. It’s perfectly reasonable for artists and writers to worry that generative AI means it’ll be harder for them to earn a living.

How much actual, novel creativity is there in the countless Tolkien pastiches filling shelves in the bookstore fantasy section? How much is that new police procedural a freestanding work of uniquely human creativity, and how much is it just the same thing we’ve seen countless times before? When an artist gets hired to do yet another anime inspired cover for a tabletop roleplaying game, or when he draws another picture in the house style, it’s difficult to say it’s meaningfully distinct from Midjourney doing the same.

You’ve probably got a floor of around 30% who will support MAGA no matter what. But the remaining 70% are coming to see what MAGA is, and are swinging hard against it. Red states are gerrymandering on the assumption that the 2026 electorate, or the 2028 one, will look similar to 2024. But the turns we saw on Tuesday mean that strategy could blow up spectacularly, wiping out what once were safe red districts. Additionally, the GOP’s far-right culture war is pissing people off.

You can, at any time, download the list and, if you want to, upload it to another newsletter platform, such as Ghost or Beehiiv. In other words, the main connection point you have with your readers (their email address) is portable. You can leave Substack, take your list elsewhere, and continue sending newsletters to your readers, without them having to resubscribe to you."

With free subscribers, you have a connection point: an email address. With paying, you have two: an email address and a credit card number. That’s why, if you turn on premium subscriptions in Substack, you have to link your Substack publication to a Stripe account. Stripe is the big player in online credit card processing. As a reader, when you pay for a Substack, you’re giving your credit card information to Stripe, and it’s Stripe that stores it, not Substack. And here’s the important bit: Most other newsletter platforms use Stripe for handling paying subscribers, too. The result is that, as a Substack publisher, even your paying subscribers are portable. Want to move to Ghost or Beehiiv? Download your Substack subscriber list, import it into the new platform, and then attach that new platform to the same Stripe account you were using for Substack. Run the handy automated migration tool your new platform comes with, and your paying subscribers will keep getting your premium content—and keep giving you money each month—without any need for them to resubscribe."

Unlike nearly every other newsletter platform, they don’t charge you anything to host a free newsletter, even if you have thousands or hundreds of thousands of subscribers. And if you do turn on premium subscriptions, their pricing model is to take 10% of your earnings, instead of asking for a fixed monthly fee. But this also means Substack needs to earn a lot more from each of the people who are running paid newsletters than other platforms, because it’s giving away so much for free to those users who aren’t. (My own Beehiiv, in contrast, offers its platform for free if you have 2,500 or fewer subscribers and don’t charge for subscriptions, and then a flat $50 or $100 a month if you want to change, and depending on which features you need. But it doesn’t take any cut of your earnings beyond that.)"

That’s the default Substack sets the price at when you turn on premium subscriptions, so it’s probably a pretty good guess.

We’ve become hedonistic, atheistic, and unmoored from the traditions that give us meaning. We choose to abandon traditional faiths, explore non-binary genders and non-traditional gender roles, have families that aren’t nuclear, and take our kids to drag queen story hours. What sets the integralists apart from, say, the National Conservatives who share many of their gripes about liberalism, is that integralists see the solution in what would effectively be a Catholic theocracy. The Roman Catholic Church is, in their minds, not just the one true faith, but also the source of the traditions and values we need to thrive."

Don’t say that. Having admirable people as friends, companions, and colleagues is actually the whole of the holy life.” (Emphasis mine.)"

Rather, the ethical life is a process of practice. It’s something we must train ourselves in. And I choose “train” precisely to distinguish this process from mere learning. You can know the rules of ethics and the principles of morality, but just as reading a book about how to throw a perfect pitch doesn’t make you a good pitcher, knowing the intellectual side of ethics doesn’t make you ethical. Rather, you need to practice. You need to internalize habits of ethical behavior, and you need to train your perspective to see the world in an ethical way."

What’s more, the fact that we recognize genuinely admirable people as admirable means that our ethical perspective has been tuned correctly. It means that we are ourselves ethical. Thus the ethical person will surround himself with admirable people, but it also requires that he be ethical to accomplish that in the first place. The holy life, then, just is the life of a person who has internalized enough of an ethical perspective that he surrounds himself with ethical people and, together, they support each other through this training and practice."

There’s a world of difference between shutting down someone’s speech, seeking to take it away, and having no interest in hearing it, or having no interest in making the speaker part of your life. Further, the narrative that disassociation is censorship is cynically used by those who want to benefit from the controversy their hateful views inevitably cause, while avoiding any social and personal consequences for their actions. It’s why so many people who claim to be the targets of cancel culture are instead just upset that others are criticizing them.

People who hold this view—well represented among those most angry at Cooper’s faith— simply can’t put themselves in the head of another, and don’t much care to.

The reason social media is addictive is the same reason we enjoy parties: It’s rapid-fire socialization with tons of people.

In a Leaflet post about disengaging from social media, Mason Stallmo wrote that, “The entire idea of encouraging people to consume what are functionally streams of conscious from other people directly is toxic for just about everything good in life.” And that’s exactly right. With a qualifier. What makes social media troubling isn’t that we should never be in a situation where we’re consuming the streams of consciousness of others, because that’s what parties are and parties are fun and rewarding. What makes social media trouble is that ours is a world where digital communication has become the dominant way many of us socially interact, and if our primary digital communication is through social media, then it’s like if we only ever interacted in the real world via parties. That would kind of suck."

Rather, it’s to layer in alternatives that provide ways of socializing that are calmer, quieter, more considered, more composed. We need spaces that aren’t short-form text or short-form video, but force us to take a moment before we speak, or to commit to something long enough that we need to think about it for a moment and decide if it’s worth saying in such a relatively more lofty form. But we also need spaces where that length doesn’t turn to paralysis.

And if they can hook into the “socializing at scale” model, so much the better. The benefit of communicating in a digital space is, unlike a party where your voice can at best carry to the other side of the room and where having it do even that probably comes off as rude, your voice can reach everyone. What we want, then, is alternatives to Bluesky, etc., that get us the slow-down-and-think-about-what-you’re-writing effects, but aren’t siloed.

But the distribution mechanism means they’re not great for the “Here’s an article I liked, a passage from it, and my brief commentary.” Part of this is ancestry. Newsletters, historically, have been longer and infrequent. They were one or two or more pages of paper you got in the mail. They were sent out monthly, or quarterly, or some frequency a good deal lower than multiple times a day. When they moved to email, and when our contemporary newsletter platforms brought them mainstream, they became the home for anyone who wanted to publish longer stuff online, but that “long and infrequent” culture stuck. When you send your newsletter to your mailing list, it’s going into their email inbox, alongside order confirmations, notes from friends, maybe all their work email, updates from their kids’ teachers, and so on. It’s a lot. Which means that if you send multiple emails a day to your list, your subscribers are going to get fussy. Even daily feels like a demand on their time. Especially because you’re pushing your posts into a space that, given everything else email is for, they really can’t set aside for the day or the week and then get to only when the mood strikes."

First, you control the PDS. In a real sense, it belongs to you. Access to it, such as the permission to write to it, is controlled by the keys you created when you made that first account. Chances are, your existing PDS lives, right now, on Bluesky’s servers, because they’re by far the biggest PDS host out there. But it doesn’t need to. Your ownership means you can move it whenever you’d like. That could be to another service or it could be to your own self-hosted server. And if you don’t like where you end up, you can move it again. Second, your PDS is platform agnostic. Yes, it can store Bluesky posts. But if you sign up for Leaflet, it’ll also store your Leaflet blogs. In fact, anyone can create a service that writes to your PDS, and so long as you give that service access, it can create entries in your personal database. Further, those services can write any kind of content imaginable. The technical term for this is a lexicon. A Bluesky post has a lexicon defining what goes into it. Date, post content, etc. A Leaflet post has its own lexicon that includes titles, polls, much longer text, etc. A TikTok alternative built on this PDS technology would define yet another lexicon that includes all the stuff needed for short-form videos."

To see it in action, highlight some text here, and then click the little “Share to Bluesky” that pops up. The resulting link preview in Bluesky will use the quote as its thumbnail image. This is exceptionally clever. The trouble is, it means you can’t share much more than a few lines of text before it just runs off the bottom of the image. But sharing big quotes from an article you like is one of the best ways to discuss it on social media. My spitballed solution is, if the quote is longer than would fit in the preview image, have Leaflet instead share an actual image, attached to the post, and then include the link in the post text."

Years ago, for a podcast, I had to watch several of the God’s Not Dead movies. For those unfamiliar, these are a series of films made by Christian evangelicals for Christian evangelicals. I’m an atheistic Buddhist, so I’m not the target audience for these movies, and not only hadn’t seen them before, but I hadn’t seen any of the movies made by the alternative movie industry that exists to serve evangelical audiences. The movies are terrible and mostly crazy, but one theme that stood out is “The world outside your narrow evangelical community is scary and threatening, and so you all need to stick together, and not let its corrupt values influence you.” It was striking how much these movies presented a world that simply doesn’t exist, not even remotely. Yet their entire game is convincing their audience it does and that they’re living in it."

Further, the way you stand out from the pack in intellectual spaces is by making unorthodox claims. If you argue conventional wisdom, you’re one among many. If you argue unconventional wisdom, you’re closer to unique. This doesn’t mean conventional wisdom is always right, or that radically departing from it is always a sign that your argument is bad.

However, because we’re talking politically charged questions here, and because you staked out a position different from the recognized experts, it’s likely not just that they disagree with your take, but that their politics are different from yours, as well.

(I suspect this is the root cause of men in traditionally male intellectual professions getting rather incensed by finding themselves now among female peers who are showing them up. And then spinning up rather silly arguments about how those women aren’t really showing them up.)"

The K-12 educational success gap isn’t new, but those status and access changes are exposing it, where before it was more hidden. This doesn’t mean we shouldn’t look for ways to bring up the educational achievement of boys, including acknowledging that boys, particularly younger boys, might need different methods to pay for their different behaviors. But it also doesn’t mean we should see the fact that the relative success of boys and girls, and then men and women, is shifting in itself a problem. If women were kept down, and now they aren’t, then it will appear that boys are losing ground. If that’s at least part of what’s going on, then the solution isn’t to drag women back down again, but to encourage our boys to recognize that it’s actually okay if the girls around them, or some of them, or many of them, are as good, if not better, at school or work or careers than they are."

Because what it’s building is quite novel, and also not clearly articulated by Threads’ leadership, it gets interpreted not as a worthy approach—even if one not for everyone—but instead as failure to accomplish the end of being a successful Twitter alternative."

Thus, when someone who shares our ideas tells us about new ideas we’re not familiar with, we tend to think their presentation of those ideas is probably accurate. Quillette is a website that has often published articles explaining ideas on the left to its predominantly right-wing audience. If you’re part of that community, and share the generally right-wing perspective of Quillette authors, but don’t know much about the left-originating ideas they discuss (critical race theory, postmodernism, etc.), you’ll likely find their explainers persuasive, not just in terms of being a reasonably accurate presentation of those ideas, but also in their conclusion that those ideas lack merit. But if you do know something about those ideas, you’ll find that Quillette presents them poorly and inaccurately. In other words, the “Quillette Effect” is an example of an ideological community tricking itself into believing it has learned about ideas outside of its tribe, when in fact it’s just flattering and reinforcing ideas internal to its tribe. And Quillette is far from alone in this. Bari Weiss’s Free Press, quite popular in online right-wing circles, plays the same game."

When you’re as rich as Musk, Andreessen, or Thiel, a great many of the people you interact with are either of your immediate social class, or are dependent upon you financially. Your immediate social class, especially the people you interact with socially, are likely to share your ideological priors, and so not challenge you at anything like a deep level. And people who are financially dependent on you are likely to reflect your ideas back to you, rather than challenging them, because they don’t want to lose your support—or they are hoping to gain it. Thus your ongoing training inputs will reflect your own ideological outputs. (The recent story of the Trump campaign buying pro-Trump ads on cable stations near Mar-a-Lago so Trump will see positive messages about himself—even though this is wasted money from a campaign strategy standpoint—is an example of this dynamic.)"

It's also what came to mind when I read the two news stories about Apple and Google pulling apps from their app stores which were helping people alert each other to ICE agents in their neighborhoods. Because here was a capitulation—and the language made it clear that's what happened—by two of the biggest, most powerful corporations in the world, and I understood why they did it. And that why, I think, is a version of the debate think tanks had during Trump's first administration. (I've been out of that world now for going on four years, so I don't know what kinds of debates are happening during Trump's second administration, but I imagine the \"He's destroying the constitutional order and we shouldn't be afraid to say so\" side has even more weight behind it this time.)"

Liberalism isn’t preferable to authoritarianism because it works better and produces more, though it does. It’s preferable because it’s moral and authoritarianism is not.

Not at the macro level, because free societies tend to in fact be quite stable, with relatively consistent growth and a healthy cultural climate overall. Rather, liberalism’s instability comes at the micro level: To be an individual in a truly free society is to live in a world constantly changing around you. The economy grows, but that growth comes through creative destruction. Businesses succeed (or some of them do), but then fail (or most of them do), only to be replaced by new businesses that end up in the same cycle. Whole industries and technologies rise and fall, making skills and creative pursuits lucrative one day and economically valueless the next."

It might be that your religion was at one time dominant and celebrated, but now is seen as fringe and backwards. It might be that your profession was at one time remunerative and held in high prestige, but now is seen as less necessary or lower status. It might be that you were at one time looked to as a thought leader and your opinions valued at the commanding heights of culture, but now you face criticism and social and intellectual marginalization."

Culture can take wrong turns. Preferences can shift in directions that later look silly. The economy can inflate bubbles, go all-in on industries without much value, or abandon industries that still have value. We have moral panics and market crashes. But the people who claim to predict the good changes in advance, or have a clear eye, before the dust has even been kicked up, for whether a particular cultural shift will look bad in hindsight are wrong at least as often as they’re right, and we all suffer from status quo biases that causes us to prefer, to one degree or another, the way things are—or have “always been”—over the way they’re going, ignoring the relentless history of status quos that today we wouldn’t want to go back to, and frequently recognize as profound moral wrongs."

We can punish those undeserving of it, and leave innocent victims in the wake of our march towards a better world. In retrospect, the errors of strategy and tactics might be clear, but in the messiness and chaos of the moment, it is too much to expect perfection. But there’s another reason that march can be loud and caustic and disorderly: The alternatives have failed. No one calls for civility with more vigor than those seeking to maintain the status quo. Those seeking to challenge it or change it are invariably told they should make their demands known through the proper channels, and with the proper measured tone of respect. And while civility can be a virtue, in so many cases it is instead employed—or the demand for it is employed—as a means to tell those who might be unruly to give up on finding freedom, respect, and the dignity liberalism builds its egalitarianism around, and instead to accept what the system has given them, or accept when the system, through its proper rules and procedures, denies them their due."

We have no choice but to accept that our status, being relative, might in some ways drop as others’ climbs, and that dropping status isn’t the same thing as restricted liberty. To value liberty, and to really mean it, we need to give up the idea that we will always benefit personally from its exercise, and give up the urge to characterize any exercise we don’t benefit personally from as not the exercise of liberty, but a sign of its decline.

It’s true many who are “on the right” are also “conservative,” but it’s not necessary that one exists alongside the other. They are not, in fact, synonyms. But our conflation of multiple concepts under these few terms gets worse. Because conservatism doesn’t mean just one thing. Instead, it’s (at least) three, and while they frequently correlate, it’s not a necessary correlation. Teasing out these concepts—the right from conservatism, and the three kinds of conservatism from each other—gives us a clearer perspective on contemporary political culture."

They’re about how one would prefer his life to be, or how he’d prefer the broader culture to be. But they say nothing about the role of government and how it ought to relate to conservative beliefs. Political conservatism, on the other hand is, about how the institutions of government should operate. One is a “conservative” in a political sense by emphasizing the wisdom embedded in past or existing laws and institutions, and worrying that changing them, too quickly or too dramatically, even in the name of progress, risks making things unintentionally worse. Political conservatism understood in this way isn’t necessarily an attempt to use the state to enforce a set of conservative values, but instead a philosophy of slow and deliberate change, informed by a perspective on tradition that says traditions persist for a reason, that they have embedded value we might not immediately recognize, and so “the way we’ve always done things” isn’t irrational inertia, but a rational appreciation for unarticulated knowledge and lessons from the past."

For right-wingers, these inequalities map onto categories like gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, and religious faith. They result in natural hierarchies, which it is wrong to interfere with, either by transgressing the boundaries between the classifications and groups, or by seeking to use social or state pressure to flatten natural hierarchies. Instead, the role of social and state pressure is to reify “natural” hierarchies, to police boundaries, and to maintain this unequal—but intrinsic and just—order. Right ideologies thus are about a particular conception of how the world is, or at least how it would be if it weren’t for improper interference, and a reactionary response to any drifting—or pushing—away from that."

There’s no tradition, no strict set of values, no deep religious faith, he holds to. He probably is socially conservative, because he believes that the culture should conform to his right-wing preferences, that social dynamism is a threat, and that coercion to make that the case is acceptable and necessary. Finally, he’s not a political conservative. He places no value on the wisdom embedded in existing institutions, and would burn the entire system to the ground if it meant getting his way. Trump’s not even politically moderate. He’s a radical, through and through, wanting to, with all haste, replace the existing political regime with an autocracy he leads. To call Trump a political conservative, but also to call someone like David French a political conservative, is to immediately recognize the incoherence of conflating the three varieties of conservatism with each other."

Identity isn’t something we can forge in a vacuum, nor is it something that can or should be entirely up to us as freely choosing, autonomous subjects. Rather, we need identities given to us, and meaning provided for us—typically by “traditional” ways of being—and both need to be (re)enforced by the government. Otherwise—and this is the inevitable result of a liberal society, they argue—we’re all cursed to become disconnected and identity-less individuals. While we might have lots of toys to play with and lots of spectacles to occupy our time, in reality, we’re adrift without the solid enough identity needed to feel settled, and without the meaning we need to be genuinely, instead of superficially, happy. In short, the anti-liberal claims that the liberal overestimates both the capacity of most people to forge meaningful identities and communal belonging in the radical autonomy liberalism asserts and the authenticity of the identities and sources of meaning that we build in this free and open liberal environment."

Which is why I was so happy to see my friends at The UnPopulist launch their new “Reconstruction Agenda” project, headed by frequent ReImagining Liberty guest Andy Craig. Andy is mapping out what that reconstruction should look like, and what reforms present the best opportunities to strengthen and rebuild the institutions of liberal democracy. Joining me today alongside Andy is Shikha Dalmia, founder and editor of The UnPopulist."
